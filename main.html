      <h1>Hi, I'm Jennifer.</h1>
      <p>For many, engagement has become a cliche. But it is
        the bread and butter of brands. Our digitally mediated
        world is changing how consumers want to be engaged,
        and the change is constant.
      </p>
      <p><b>I am at the forefront of that change. I help brands
        find new ways to connect with consumers in a constantly
        evolving world.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Currently, I am an Assistant Marketing Manager at DBS Bank,
        where I pioneered a WeChat podcast program that achieved
        a 120% increase in interactions. I also produced a
        live-stream movie premiere that hit 8M video views in
        a single day.
      </p>
      <p>As a Shanghai-born Singapore-raised native speaker
        of 3 languages, I am also a bridge between East and West.
        When I'm not on the job, I indulge my love for the
        performing arts, dystopian literature, and German-style board games.
      <p><em>My specialties include digital engagement, social media
        marketing, cross-cultural communication, event management,
        singing R&B songs, and jazz dancing.</em>
